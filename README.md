# About
A collection of data structures using C# generics.

# Usage
Program files are kept within the _master_ branch.

All classes are kept within the __AbstractLists.cs__ file in the namespace __Adscol__, to be included within the program. All currently implemented structures are written at the top of the file.

The __Program.cs__ file contains working tests for most/all methods for each data structure.
